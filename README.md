# reinforcement_learning

My objective is to train a model to play Tetris. 

Senior year of my undergrad, I got really into Tetris. While llearning about machine learning and reinforcement learning, I considered building this as my senior project. Now that I have a little more knowledge and experience and time, jumping back into this. 

Step 1: Build a simpler Tetris as our minimum viable product, just go to get it off the ground. I won't get to learn anything about Reinforcement Learning (RL) if I get stuck on building the game. Instead of shapes, it'll just be 1 individual block at a time. It'll be on a smaller board.
